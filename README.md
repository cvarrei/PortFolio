# PortFolio

## This portfolio serves as a repository for various data science and data analysis projects. I hope it will help all those who need to do similar tasks. 
### In this portfolio, the different tasks are done with Python or R (and soon SQL).

- **Project 1 (Done with R)**: This is a simulation project to compare the results obtained with a meta-meta-analysis (meta-analysis of meta-analysis results) and those of a simple meta-analysis including all clinical studies without duplication. The rationale behind this project was to assess the indirect influence of the duplicity of clinical studies on the outcome of the meta-meta-analysis. 
It relies on loops to perform the task for different quantities. 
Duplicity can be modified with the number of simulated primary clinical studies and/or the number of clinical studies included in the single meta-analyses.

- **Project 2 (Done with Python)**: This is a project to "market research" Android applications to find out what type of application would be most likely to work and be successful with the Android user community.  It involves Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis.

- **Project 3 (Done with R)**: This is a project of data visualization of a time-series dataset (Tesla's Stock Price from its IPO to March 17, 2017. The dashboard was created to visualise the evolution of Tesla's share price when its model.
